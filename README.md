This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

Among the various typographic scales, the most commonly used in web design are:

### 1. **Major Second (1.125)**
### 2. **Minor Third (1.2)**
### 3. **Major Third (1.25)**
### 4. **Perfect Fourth (1.333)**
### 5. **Golden Ratio (1.618)**

#### **Major Second (1.125)**
- **Usage:** This scale is subtle and often used in text-heavy websites like blogs or articles where readability is paramount. It provides a gentle progression in font sizes, which helps maintain a cohesive visual structure without large jumps between text sizes.
- **Example sizes:** 16px, 18px, 20px, 22px, 25px, 28px

#### **Minor Third (1.2)**
- **Usage:** Slightly more noticeable than the Major Second, this scale is popular for websites that need a bit more differentiation between elements while still maintaining readability. It is often used for paragraphs, headings, and subheadings in content-driven sites.
- **Example sizes:** 16px, 19px, 23px, 28px, 34px, 41px

#### **Major Third (1.25)**
- **Usage:** The Major Third scale offers a clear distinction between different typographic elements, making it ideal for websites where visual hierarchy is important, such as marketing sites, portfolios, and landing pages. It helps in creating a strong and easily navigable structure.
- **Example sizes:** 16px, 20px, 25px, 31px, 39px, 49px

#### **Perfect Fourth (1.333)**
- **Usage:** This scale strikes a balance between readability and visual hierarchy, making it versatile for a wide range of web designs. It's commonly used in both content-heavy sites and more visually oriented designs where a moderate difference in text size is needed.
- **Example sizes:** 16px, 21px, 28px, 37px, 49px, 65px

#### **Golden Ratio (1.618)**
- **Usage:** The Golden Ratio is favored for its aesthetic appeal and harmonious proportions. It is often used in high-end design projects, creative portfolios, and sites that aim for a striking and balanced visual presentation. This scale creates significant differentiation between elements, making it effective for emphasizing important content.
- **Example sizes:** 16px, 26px, 42px, 68px, 110px, 178px

### Conclusion
While all the scales mentioned have their uses, the Major Second, Minor Third, Major Third, Perfect Fourth, and Golden Ratio are the most commonly used due to their balance between readability and visual hierarchy. The choice of scale often depends on the specific design requirements and the type of content being presented. For most general purposes, the Major Third (1.25) and Minor Third (1.2) scales are particularly popular because they offer a good mix of subtlety and distinction, making them versatile for a wide range of web design projects.
